# CLAUDE.md

This is the root Claude Code config

## System

- When installing packages on macOS, prefer `brew`
- Prefer `bun` to `npm` for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- `zsh` with `oh-my-zsh` is the default shell

## Security

- Never install global system packages without explicit confirmation.
- Never overwrite or existing files without explicit confirmation.

## Style

- When drafting PR bodies or commit messages, be concise and succinct. Avoid 
  unnecessary verbosity and extraneous adjectives. Use terse bullet points to summarize changes.
- When writing code:
    - follow the project's existing style guides and conventions
    - embrace idiomatic patterns and best practices
    - avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering
    - Prefer MVP-caliber approaches over over-engineered solutions
